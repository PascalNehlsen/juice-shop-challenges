### Introduction

The OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed to demonstrate security issues, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This report details the steps I followed to complete the API-only XSS challenge.

### Objective

The objective of this challenge was to exploit an XSS vulnerability through the API endpoints of the Juice Shop application. The approach involved embedding malicious scripts into a product's description to see if these would execute in the browser. Successfully completing the challenge required persisting an XSS payload within the application.

### Approach

#### Step 1: Information Gathering

To identify where persistent data is stored within the shop, I examined product descriptions as a likely target. Using Burp Suite's "Intercept" feature, I intercepted the HTTP requests within the application to analyze the API calls involved.

Upon reviewing the HTTP history, I found a `GET` request to `/api/Quantitys/`. I then sent this request to Burp Suite's Repeater tool for modification. By changing the API endpoint to `/api/Products/`, I accessed a complete JSON response containing all product details.

Sample Product in JSON Format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Apple Juice (1000ml)",
  "description": "The all-time classic.",
  "price": 1.99,
  "deluxePrice": 0.99,
  "image": "apple_juice.jpg",
  "createdAt": "2024-10-24T10:01:58.486Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-24T10:01:58.486Z",
  "deletedAt": null
}
```

#### Step 2: Analyzing API Endpoints

After identifying the product data, I further explored the Juice Shop API endpoints. By sending an `OPTIONS` request to `/api/Products/`, I confirmed that the API supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH).

```bash
OPTIONS /api/Products/ HTTP/1.1
```

Since attempts to update product data with the `PATCH` method were unsuccessful (resulting in a 500 status code), I opted to use the `PUT` method, which replaces data in its entirety. Additionally, I set the `Content-Type` to `application/json`, as the GET response data format was JSON. With IDs listed in the JSON data, I accessed the first product directly via `/api/products/1`.

I first tested updating the product description without any XSS payload:

**PUT Request to Update Product Description**

```bash
PUT /api/products/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

{
"description": "OWASP is King"
}
```

The server responded with a 200 status code, confirming the update:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Apple Juice (1000ml)",
    "description": "OWASP is King",
    "price": 1.99,
    "deluxePrice": 0.99,
    "image": "apple_juice.jpg",
    "createdAt": "2024-10-24T10:01:58.486Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-24T11:06:53.363Z",
    "deletedAt": null
  }
}
```

On checking the OWASP Juice Shop UI, the product description was successfully updated.

#### Step 3: Injecting XSS Payload

To complete the challenge, I attempted to add an iframe to the description with a JavaScript payload:

```json
{
  "description": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">"
}
```

When testing without escaped double quotes, the server returned a 500 error due to syntax issues. Adding backslashes before the double quotes (`\"`) allowed the payload to be processed, resulting in a 200 status code.

Upon refreshing the OWASP Juice Shop page, I observed the modified product description. The XSS payload executed as intended when viewing the product, confirming the successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability.

### Conclusion

This test successfully completed the API-only XSS Challenge by embedding a persistent XSS payload in the description of the Apple Juice product through a direct API request, bypassing the web frontend.
